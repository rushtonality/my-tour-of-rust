# My Tour of Rust

## Ray Tracing in a Weekend

I wanted to provide more structure to my learning, so I decided
to work on an actual project.  I follow Peter Shirley on twitter [@Peter_shirley](https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley),
and I have been meaning to go through his book [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend).
So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and use that a structure
to learning some Rust.
